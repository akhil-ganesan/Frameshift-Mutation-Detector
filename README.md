# Frameshift-Mutation-Detector
This repository contains the code for the project "Detecting & Extracting Information from Genetically-Mutated Data Using AI" (Project Paper: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z03PWq5cVhoDv7AGSaVYgWjgcoqVOctj/view). This project applies neural networks to predict frameshift defects in generalized data (with around 95% accuracy) & extract information about substitution defects from frameshifted data (with around 80% accuracy).
