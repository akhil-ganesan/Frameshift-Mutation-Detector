# Frameshift-Mutation-Detector
This repository contains the code for the project "Detecting & Extracting Information from Genetically-Mutated Data Using AI" (Project Paper: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qMS6Q1Ku_iFkFaAz5EEVgxdEN13QFv47/view?usp=sharing). This project applies neural networks to predict frameshift defects in generalized data (with around 95% accuracy) & extract information about substitution defects from frameshifted data (with around 80% accuracy).
